# SpringBoot In practice 


## Spring Framework
To master Spring Boot you need to learn the Spring framework first. So we will suggest, you must know the basics of the Spring framework at least. Without learning the core spring firework you are not going to get the “Ahh!!” moment about Spring Boot such as what are the things it carries to the table. In the spring framework, you need to learn these things

## Core:
Bean Life Cycle
Dependency Injection
Inversion of Control
Bean Factory and Application Context
- Web:
    - Annotations
    - MVC Structure
    - Configuration
    - Integrating different libraries/frameworks (Like Hibernate)
- Profiles
    - AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming):
    - How AOP Works
    - Creating PointCut, JoinPoint, Aspect, etc (Basics Only)
- Spring Security
  It is a powerful and highly customizable authentication and access-control framework. It provides both authorization and authentication to Java applications. Like all Spring projects, the true power of Spring Security is found in how easily it can be extended to meet custom requirements. You need to learn the following concepts in Spring Security
    - Authentication
    - Authorization
    - OAuth2
    - Form Authentications
    - JWT(JSON Web Token)
4. Spring Boot
    - Once you have an understanding of spring firework and how to implement spring security that is the time you need to switch to spring boot. And at that time you are going to get the “Ahh!!” moment about Spring Boot because whatever you did and whatever the configuration you are doing for the spring application that everything will be automated in the spring boot. So let’s see what you need to learn in spring boot

- Importance of Spring Boot

You have to understand the importance of spring boot this is why spring boot was there and how it is beneficial to create the application. Ideally, the spring boot is used to create the RAD (Rapid Application Development) level application and to create the microservices. In the microservices world spring boot is the most famous framework.


- Auto Configuration and Adding Configuration

Spring Boot comes with auto-configuration. Whatever the configuration you accomplish while creating the spring application using the spring web and spring AOP you have to do add a lot of configurations. These all configurations are been automated, auto-configured in the spring boot. So by default configuration would be always there, but whenever you want to modify these configurations you can modify all those configurations. So you should learn all these things like how to modify a particular configuration which is been autoconfigured. So that is a really important part of the spring boot because it is always not advisable to use the default configuration though these configurations are created with certain parameters kept in mind.

-  Properties/YAML

You must be aware of how to create different properties files for the different profiles and you can also create the YAML file.

- Integration with other libraries/frameworks

You should also learn how to integrate different libraries suppose you want to integrate the MySQL database with your spring boot application so you needed to learn how to do that.

- REST API

Ideally, spring boot is used to create the REST APIs to be consumed or to be consumed by the other application and to use in the microservices. You just learn the following things in REST - API

- HTTP Methods:
  POST
  GET
  PUT
  DELETE
  OPTIONS
  TRACE
  HTTP Status Codes:
  1.X.X
  2.X.X
  3.X.X
  4.X.X
  5.X.X
- Databases
  Now comes the database part of the spring boot because your backend is really important for creating your application. So you must learn different types of database

- SQL:
  MySQL
  PostgreSQL
  Oracle
  NoSQL:
  MongoDB
  Cassandra
  Spring Data
  We will suggest starting with the SQL Database so from that database you will get a core knowledge of how a database works and how are the different operations performed in the database.

                To use any of the databases with your spring boot application you have to learn the spring data. Spring data can be used to configure and use the different databases that are available. So following are the things you should learn in Spring Data

- Spring Data JPA
- Spring Data MongoDB
- Spring Data JDBC
